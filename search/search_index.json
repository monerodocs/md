Funds protected with multisig can only be spent by signing with M-of-N keys.\n\n\nExample use cases:\n\n\n\n\nshared account (1-of-2; both husband and wife individually have full access to their funds)\n\n\nconsensus account (2-of-2; both husband and wife must agree to spend their funds)\n\n\nthreshold account (2-of-3; an escrow service is involved as an independent 3rd party, to co-sign with either the seller, or with the buyer, if seller and buyer do not agree)\n\n\nsecure account (2-of-3; a single owner controlls all 3 keys but secures them via a different means to diversify risks)\n\n\narbitrary threshold account (M-of-N; some cryptocurrencies provide full flexibility on the number of signers)\n\n\n\n\nMonero multisignature\n\n\nMonero doesn't directly implement multisignatures (at least not in a classical sense). Monero emulates the feature by secret splitting.\n\n\nTransactions are still signed with a single spend key. The spend key is a sum of all N private keys. The rationale for such design is to decouple multisig from ring signatures.\n\n\nLet's consider the 2-of-3 scheme. We have 3 participants. Each participant is granted exactly 2 private keys in a way that pairs do not repeat between participants. This way any 2 participants together have all 3 private keys required to create the private spend key.\n\n\nMulti-signing is a wallet-level feature. There is no way to learn from the blockchain which transactions were created using multiple signatures.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting in Monero there is no multisig addresses as such. \nAddress structure\n does not care how the underlying private spend key got created.\n\n\nIn Monero, only N-of-N and (N-1)-of-N multisignature schemes are supported.

Transactions are still signed with a single spend key. The spend key is a sum of all N private keys. The rationale for such design is to decouple multisig from ring signatures.  Let's consider the 2-of-3 scheme. We have 3 participants. Each participant is granted exactly 2 private keys in a way that pairs do not repeat between participants. This way any 2 participants together have all 3 private keys required to create the private spend key.  Multi-signing is a wallet-level feature. There is no way to learn from the blockchain which transactions were created using multiple signatures.  It is also worth noting in Monero there is no multisig addresses as such.
