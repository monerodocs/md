# CryptoNight Proof of Work

Possibly the most controversial aspect of Monero (and other CryptoNote coins) is the CryptoNight Proof of Work,
composed of 7 functions. Fortunately, the difficulty would auto-adjust should any major PoW "shortcuts" be discovered.
Still, it poses theoretical centralization risk, if the attacker manages to keep PoW exploit secret.
